Academic Course Credit
#####################################

If your institution has an agreement with edX, you might be able to offer
academic credit for your course. Learners will be able to purchase this
academic credit after they meet requirements that you set. These requirements
typically include identity checks throughout the course as well as ID
verification at the beginning of the course. Learners can see a list of the
requirements on their **Progress** page.

If your course will include academic credit, your edX program manager will
complete the initial setup of your course, including setting the price of
credit and enabling your course to offer credit. You must then complete two
steps.

#. :ref:`Specify the minimum score that a learner must earn to receive
   academic credit in the course <Specify Passing Score>`.
#. :ref:`Add identity checks to the course <Add Identity Checks>`.

.. _Specify Passing Score:

Specify the Passing Score

In addition to setting the usual grade scale for your course, you indicate a
specific score that a learner must receive to earn credit for your course.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then select **Grading**.
#. In the **Credit Eligibility** section, specify a score followed by
   a percent sign (%) in the **Minimum Credit-Eligible Grade** box.
   This score can be any number from 1 to 100.

.. _Add Identity Checks:

Add Identity Checks
****************************

For courses that offer academic credit, edX has two forms of identity checks:
*in-course reverification (ICRV)* and *proctored exams*. You can use either
feature or both features in your course.

* ICRV allows you to add identity verification "checkpoints" at specific
  locations in your course, such as before assessments or exams. When learners
  reach a checkpoint, they must use their computer's webcam to verify their
  identity, similar to the original ID verification process, before they can
  access more course content.

  For more information, see :ref:`In Course Reverification`.

* Proctored exams...
