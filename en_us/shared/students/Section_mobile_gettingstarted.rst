.. _Getting Started:

======================================
Do I need an edX account?
======================================

You need to have an edX account before you can enroll in courses. You can sign
up for an edX account in the edX mobile app, or use a browser to go to the
`edx.org`_ website. When you create your account, you need to be connected to
the Internet.

======================================
How do I create an edX account?
======================================

When you open the edX mobile app, select **Sign up and start learning**. You
can create an edX account using your email address or your Facebook or Google
account. You also provide the following information.

* Your name.
* The username that will identify you to course teams and to other learners.
* A password.
* Your country or region.

After you create your account, you can find courses that interest you and
enroll in them.


===========================================
How do I create or edit my user profile?
===========================================

Your edX profile allows you to share information about yourself with the edX
community. Course teams and other learners in your courses can view your
profile when they tap your linked username.

After you have created and activated your edX account, you can edit your user
profile. By default, you share a limited profile that consists of your
username and an optional profile picture.

To create or edit your profile details in the mobile app, tap your username or
profile picture. Select the pencil icon to edit your profile details. Within
profile details, select **Change** next to the camera icon to change your
profile picture.

.. note:: If you are under 13 years of age, you cannot add a profile picture.
   Other edX users see only your username in your limited profile.

If you want to share more information about yourself with other members of the
edX commmunity, you can change your limited profile to a full profile. In the
**About Me** section, you can indicate your primary language and share some
details about yourself, such as your learning goals and other interests. To
share a full profile, in your profile details, tap **Full Profile**.

.. note:: You must specify your birth year before you can share a full
   profile. If you are under 13 years of age, you cannot create a full
   profile.


==================================================
How do I find courses to take?
==================================================

When you open the app and sign in to your edX account, you see a list of the
mobile-friendly courses that you are currently enrolled in. At the end of the
list, select **Find a Mobile-Friendly Course**.

You can also use the menu at the top of the page. Select **Find Courses**.
