Self-Paced Courses
##################

Most edX courses are *instructor-paced*: they follow a schedule
that the instructor sets, with assignments and exams that have specific due
dates. EdX also offers a number of *self-paced* courses, which allow
you to submit assignments and exams at any time before the course end date.

************************************************************
Differences between Instructor- and Self-Paced Courses
************************************************************

Instructor-paced courses follow a set schedule. Course materials become
available at specific times as the course progresses. Assignments have
specified due dates, and exams have specific start and end dates. During the
course, indicators show you when you have a homework assignment or exam, as
well as the due date for the assignment or exam.

Self-paced courses do not follow a traditional schedule. All course materials
are available as soon as the course begins. Assignments and exams do not have
start or due dates. You can submit an assignment or exam at any time before the
course end date.
